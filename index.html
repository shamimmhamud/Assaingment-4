        <p>Here is a quote from My friends details:</p>
        <blockquote cite="http://www.shamimmhamud.org/index.html">
        It doesn't matter how many times we watch Friends, because some of these Easter eggs are so small they're almost impossible to catch.
        True Friends fans will attest to watching the show all the way through several times. With the daily reruns and instant availability on Netflix, new fans continue to discover the show as well, but for many of us the iconic sitcom is pure comfort food and demands to be watched time and time again because we love spending time with these characters, despite their flaws. The gang feel like our friends too, and we’ll never really say goodbye to them. A revival would be nice, but that’s never going to happen.
